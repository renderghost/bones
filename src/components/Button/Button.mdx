## Usage Guidelines

1. Use **Primary** buttons for the main action on a page or in a section.
2. Use **Secondary** buttons for alternative or less important actions.
3. Use **Caution** buttons sparingly, only for actions that need extra attention or might have significant consequences.
4. Use **Transparent** buttons for less prominent actions or in areas where a solid button might be too visually heavy.
5. Choose the appropriate size based on the button's importance and the available space.
6. Use icons to enhance the button's meaning, but ensure the label is clear and descriptive.
7. Avoid using too many buttons in close proximity to prevent overwhelming the user.

## Accessibility

The Button component follows these accessibility best practices:

-   Uses semantic `<button>` elements
-   Provides appropriate contrast ratios for all variants and states
-   Includes `aria-label` for icon-only buttons
-   Communicates loading and disabled states to screen readers

## Props

<ArgTypes of={ButtonStories.Playground} />

## Best Practices

1. Use clear, action-oriented labels (e.g., "Submit" instead of "OK")
2. Ensure sufficient contrast between the button and its background
3. Group related actions together
4. Use loading state for actions that may take time to complete
5. Provide feedback after the button is clicked (e.g., success message, error notification)
6. Consider mobile users and ensure buttons are large enough for touch interactions
