{/* ## Props */}

{/* <ArgTypes of={ButtonStories} /> */}

## Variants

Buttons come in four visual styles, each designed for specific use cases:

{/* <Canvas> */}

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '16px', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>
	<Story of={ButtonStories.Primary} />
	<Story of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />
	<Story of={ButtonStories.Caution} />
	<Story of={ButtonStories.Transparent} />
</div>
{/* </Canvas> */}

<Canvas>
	<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '16px', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>
		<Story of={ButtonStories.Primary} />
		<Story of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />
		<Story of={ButtonStories.Caution} />
		<Story of={ButtonStories.Transparent} />
	</div>
</Canvas>

{/* <Canvas> */}

<Story of={ButtonStories.Primary} />
<Story of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />
<Story of={ButtonStories.Caution} />
<Story of={ButtonStories.Transparent} />
{/* </Canvas> */}

<Canvas>
	<Story of={ButtonStories.Primary} />
	<Story of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />
	<Story of={ButtonStories.Caution} />
	<Story of={ButtonStories.Transparent} />
</Canvas>

-   **Primary**: Use for the main call-to-action on a page.
-   **Secondary**: For secondary actions that complement the primary action.
-   **Caution**: Used for actions that require user attention or might have significant consequences.
-   **Transparent**: Useful for less prominent actions or in contexts where a solid button might be too visually heavy.

## Sizes

Buttons are available in three sizes to accommodate different design needs:

<Canvas>
	<Story of={ButtonStories.Small} />
	<Story of={ButtonStories.Medium} />
	<Story of={ButtonStories.Large} />
</Canvas>

## Content Types

The Button component supports various content configurations:

<Canvas>
	<Story of={ButtonStories.LabelOnly} />
	<Story of={ButtonStories.LeftIcon} />
	<Story of={ButtonStories.RightIcon} />
	<Story of={ButtonStories.BothIcons} />
	<Story of={ButtonStories.IconOnly} />
</Canvas>

## States

Buttons have different states to provide visual feedback to users:

<Canvas>
	<Story of={ButtonStories.Default} />
	<Story of={ButtonStories.Hover} />
	<Story of={ButtonStories.Active} />
	<Story of={ButtonStories.Focus} />
	<Story of={ButtonStories.Disabled} />
	<Story of={ButtonStories.Loading} />
</Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

1. Use **Primary** buttons for the main action on a page or in a section.
2. Use **Secondary** buttons for alternative or less important actions.
3. Use **Caution** buttons sparingly, only for actions that need extra attention or might have significant consequences.
4. Use **Transparent** buttons for less prominent actions or in areas where a solid button might be too visually heavy.
5. Choose the appropriate size based on the button's importance and the available space.
6. Use icons to enhance the button's meaning, but ensure the label is clear and descriptive.
7. Avoid using too many buttons in close proximity to prevent overwhelming the user.

## Accessibility

The Button component follows these accessibility best practices:

-   Uses semantic `<button>` elements
-   Provides appropriate contrast ratios for all variants and states
-   Includes `aria-label` for icon-only buttons
-   Communicates loading and disabled states to screen readers

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the Button component in your React application:

```jsx
import Button from './Button';
import { ArrowRight } from 'lucide-react';

function ExampleComponent() {
	return (
		<Button
			label='Submit'
			variant='primary'
			size='medium'
			contentType='rightIcon'
			rightIcon={ArrowRight}
			onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked!')}
		/>
	);
}
```

This example shows a primary button with a right icon, using the "medium" size.

## Best Practices

1. Use clear, action-oriented labels (e.g., "Submit" instead of "OK")
2. Ensure sufficient contrast between the button and its background
3. Group related actions together
4. Use loading state for actions that may take time to complete
5. Provide feedback after the button is clicked (e.g., success message, error notification)
6. Consider mobile users and ensure buttons are large enough for touch interactions

By following these guidelines and utilizing the Button component's various props, you can create consistent, accessible, and user-friendly interfaces across your application.
